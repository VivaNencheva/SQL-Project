# SQL-Project
In this project, I performed data cleaning on a layoffs dataset using SQL. Key tasks included removing duplicates, standardizing dates, handling null or blank values, and optimizing the dataset by restructuring columns. These steps ensured the data was accurate and ready for analysis, showcasing my ability to prepare raw data for meaningful insights.
